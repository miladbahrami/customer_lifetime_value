# Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
 Predicting customer lifetime value in non-contractual situations in which customers can make purchase at any time.

In every business it is important to find the most valuable customers. The [Pareto Principle](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) says 20% of your customers represent 80% of your sales. So it would be a great opportunity for the company, if we could identify that 20%, not only historically, but in the future as well. CLV can help us to identify these customers.
